To create larger spacer panels:

To make taller, combine same-length panels as necessary... simply put the top/bottom faces together and combine into one body.

To make longer, identify two same-height panels that combine to yield the desired length.
Ignore (or delete) the tabs of the sides to be joined.
Place the two joining faces 2.4mm apart and extrude until they are joined.

If this is confusing, practice by combining two 1x2 pieces into a 2x2 panel and then combine two 2x1 panels into a 2x2 panel.
Compare to provided 2x2 panels to understand where adjustments must be made.
